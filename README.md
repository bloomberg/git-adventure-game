This workshop is for anyone who has ever felt nervous using Git. We’ll help you face your fears with this ‘choose your own adventure’ style game, where you will use Git commands to make choices and solve puzzles. Enter the Haunted Forest, explore the mysteries that lie within and see if you can survive the night!

To play this game you will need access to the Git CLI https://git-scm.com/downloads

In general in this game git branches refer to locations, and commits refer to things that have happened in the past so the commit history of a branch will tell the story of what happened in a certain place. Files represent something in the environment that can be interacted with in some way e.g. a tree or a building.

These sripts will be available to you:

'look' will display information about where you currently are.
'hint' will display increasingly explicit hints.
'help' will display help for the git command that that is needed.
'reset' will reset the current challenge.

To begin run the 'start_game' script.

Thanks for playing and we hope you enjoy the game!
