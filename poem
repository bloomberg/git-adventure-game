  |  'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves           |
  |  Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:              |
  |  All mimsy were the borogoves,                 |
  |  And the mome raths outgrabe.                  |
  |                                                |
  |  'Beware the Jabberwock, my son!               |
  |  The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!     |
  |  Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun              |
  |  The frumious Bandersnatch!'                   |
  |                                                |
  |  He took his vorpal sword in hand:             |
  |  Long time the manxome foe he sought-          |
  |  So rested he by the Tumtum tree,              |
  |  And stood awhile in thought.                  |
